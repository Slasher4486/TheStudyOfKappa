It could make you smarter
Research suggests wearing a lab coat everyday could actually make you better at your job. people associate the clothing with care and attentiveness, and therefore show heightened attention to tasks when dressed accordingly. Specifically, the doctors and nurses who participated showed an increase in concentration and a decrease in overall errors. Another study asked students, none of whom were studying medicine, to wear a white lab coat and perform a series of complex tasks. Those in white coats made significantly fewer mistakes than the people in their street clothes. The scientists then repeated the experiment but this time gave lab coats to all the participants. They told half the people they were doctor's coats and the other half they were paint smocks. Guess who performed better? It just goes to show that its not just what you wear but also what you think of what you wear that counts.
